🧠 Adaptive AI Fitness Coach – Quick Start Guide (for first-time users)
🔹 Step 1 – Choose your AI assistant
You can use this prompt with any modern generative AI assistant that supports longer prompts and ongoing dialogue, such as:

ChatGPT (Plus or Enterprise recommended)

Claude (Anthropic)

Perplexity (Pro)

Others that support prompt memory and multi-step interactions

🔹 Step 2 – Paste the prompt
Open your AI chat tool

Copy and paste the entire prompt (provided as prompt.md) into the chat

Send or run it like a regular message

🔹 Step 3 – Answer the onboarding questions
The AI will ask you a few basic things to get started, like:

What is your fitness goal?

How often do you train?

Do you have any injuries?

What kind of coaching tone works for you?

💡 Just reply like you're chatting with a real coach — no special format needed.

🔹 Step 4 – Use it daily
Each day, you can:

Ask for your personalized training plan

Report what you did (“I did my workout”, “I ate…” etc.)

Request tips or adjustments

Ask for food or form feedback

Get challenged or encouraged depending on your style

The AI remembers your answers and evolves the coaching plan over time.

✅ Good to Know:
You don’t need to install anything — this works inside the AI chat.

The system is designed to motivate, guide, and hold you accountable — not replace doctors or licensed trainers.

You can train at home or outside — the AI will adapt to your equipment, time, and preferences.

⚠️ Important:
This is not medical advice.
Use this system at your own risk and always consult a qualified coach or doctor before making major changes to your training or diet.
